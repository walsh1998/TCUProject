For the first Crossroads Analytics Competition, we were tasked with predicting daily total cash used for each branch for Teacher's Credit Union. Our idea was to utilize machine learning techniques while using a feature engineering approach. We tried several different types of linear and tree-based models, but our final model was a LightGBM model with a SMAPE of 84. Furthermore, we were able to create an addition tableau dashboard to showcase the strengths and weaknesses of our model. 

We won 2nd place in the competition ($3000).
